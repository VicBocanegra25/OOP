In this
game, eight cards are randomly chosen from a deck. The first card is shown
face up. The game asks the player to predict whether the next card in the
selection will have a higher or lower value than the currently showing card.
For example, say the card that’s shown is a 3. The player chooses “higher,”
and the next card is shown. If that card has a higher value, the player is
correct. In this example, if the player had chosen “lower,” they would have
been incorrect.
If the player guesses correctly, they get 20 points. If they choose incorrectly,
they lose 15 points. If the next card to be turned over has the same
value as the previous card, the player is incorrect.

********************************************************************************

The cards will be represented in a list (a deck contains 52 cards).

Each of the 52 elements in the list will be a dictionary (a set of key/value
pairs).

{'rank': 'Jack', 'suit': 'Clubs', 'value': 11}

shuffled copy of it.

4.- Write a loop that asks the user if the next card will be higher or lower

- pick a card

5.- If the user was correct,
        add 20 points
    elif the card is the same:
        substract 15 points
    else
        substract 15

6.- Shuffle the deck and pick a card
